# Conflict of Interest (COI) Policy

The Minnesota High School Fencing League (MNHSFL) is committed to upholding the highest standards of integrity, transparency, and accountability as a nonprofit organization. This Conflict of Interest Policy applies to all board members, officers, and key volunteers.

**1. Duty to Disclose:**
Any actual or potential conflict of interest must be promptly disclosed to the board. A conflict of interest exists when a board member, officer, or key volunteer has a personal, financial, or other interest that could influence their decisions or actions on behalf of MNHSFL.

**2. Recusal from Decision-Making:**
Any person with a conflict must abstain from participating in related discussions, decisions, or votes. The board may request additional information and determine whether a conflict exists and what steps are necessary to protect the organization.

**3. Documentation:**
All conflicts and recusals will be recorded in the meeting minutes.

**4. Annual Disclosure:**
Board members and officers will complete a simple annual disclosure form listing any affiliations, financial interests, or relationships that could present a conflict.

**5. Good Faith:**
MNHSFL expects all board members, officers, and volunteers to act in good faith and in the best interests of the organization, avoiding even the appearance of impropriety.

Questions or concerns about conflicts should be brought to the board for review and resolution.
