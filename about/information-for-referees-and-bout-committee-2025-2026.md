# Minnesota High School Fencing Coaches Association Information for Referees and Bout Committee 2025–2026

## Introduction

This document is intended to supply referees and bout committee members for Minnesota High School Fencing League events with basic information about league events.

## Tournament formats

Most tournaments consist of pools with 5-touch bouts followed by a direct-elimination bracket with 15-touch bouts with a fence-off for third place. The State Championship Relay Tournament is a direct-elimination relay event with a fence-off for third place.

These will be large events lasting most of the day and will be difficult to keep on schedule. Fencers (other than the ones you are currently refereeing) and spectators with questions should be directed to their team’s coaches so you can focus on refereeing.

## Rules 

We generally follow 2023 USA Fencing rules (but see equipment below). These links may be helpful:

## Dietary restrictions

Each tournament will have food and beverages for the referees. If you have any food allergies or other dietary restrictions, please let the tournament organizer know when you tell them you can work the tournament so they can be sure to have food you can eat. 

## Signals and scoring machines

As you know, it can be difficult for spectators (and sometimes for fencers) to understand referee calls. We ask that you use the official signals, high enough for people to see, and project your voice when making your calls. Also, if you have a scoring machine with a remote so that it can show time and/or score and/or cards, please use those features; it is helpful for both spectators and fencers (but remember that cards also need to be recorded on the score sheet even if they show on the scoring machine). 

## Concussion training

Minnesota state law requires that you have completed concussion training to work any sports involving athletes 18 and under; this certification is generally good for three years. If you don’t have current certification, the best way to get it is from the [NFHS website](https://nfhslearn.com/courses/concussion-in-sports-2). Be sure to save a copy or your certificate.

## Payment

Payment policies may differ by tournament and should be communicated to referees beforehand. There will likely be a sign-in/sign-out sheet, and you may need to fill out a W-9 form before the school business office can process payment. Please contact the tournament organizer if you haven’t received a check within 3 weeks of the tournament.

## Enforcing sportsmanship rules

While these events are relatively rare, over the years, we have seen masks spiked and drop kicked across the room, people refusing to shake hands after a bout, people abusing referees, people screaming in opponents’ faces, and fencers deliberately attempting to injure opponents; unfortunately, all of these occurred without a black card being issued.

Fencers have been instructed about acceptable behavior and told, for example, to not bring non-fencing-related items (e.g., food, stuffed animals, signs, balloons) to the strip. Please warn fencers, coaches, and spectators if appropriate and use Third Group and Fourth Group penalties as needed. If you issue a Third Group penalty, be sure to report it to the Bout Committee.

If referees consistently enforce behavior standards throughout the season, it will prevent sportsmanship and behavior problems from escalating.

## Equipment

All protective equipment rules will be strictly enforced for safety reasons. Fencers will need to get masks and saber gloves inspected prior to the start of fencing; please verify inspection marks on those items. Long socks are required to overlap the knickers when the fencer is in the en garde position. Knickers are required.

Please do not card for lamé issues since those are not inspected at check-in. Please **do** card for non-functioning weapons, mask cords, or body cords as well as if there is no retainer clip. Please inspect weights and shims and card nonconforming weapons. Fencers are not required to have a spare weapon, body cord, or mask cord at the strip; send for a team coach if a fencer has an issue during the bout. 

 If there is an equipment issue, you can confiscate the nonconforming item, but if there is a team coach who is available to be responsible for the item (e.g., the coach wants to label the item and put it with the teams “to be fixed” pile), the coach can take possession of the item.

## Appeals

Fencers have been given information about what is subject to appeal, who can appeal, and how to appeal. If a fencer calls for the Bout Committee, have someone go to get the head referee. Note that if the bout effectively recommences and then a fencer wants to protest an earlier ruling, or if they unhook from the strip, no appeals are possible. Detailed information about how these procedures work, with examples, are included in the Appeals Process, Bout Committee, and Jury of Appeals document.
